idk why this was made, but its pretty poorly put together.

pretty easy setup(basically nothing)

just put the database, compiled c2, and config files on a server give perms to c2 and run it.

a default admin user will be generated.

for more info read the tutorial.txt file included.

thats all this is a highly low effort readmeðŸ¤
